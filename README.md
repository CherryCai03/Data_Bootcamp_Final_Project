 # Project Abstract
We are exploying in: How have the Real Estate Investment Structure Changed in China over the Last 15 Years?

This project studys how the investment in real estate evolve over time at a narrow geographic level within China. Since the 21st century, China had developed in jet speed. Regardless of the house pricing in the original first-tier cities, e.g. Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, less-developed cities like Chengdu, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Xiâ€™an actually had the biggest price gain in the House price in recent years. Real estate investment had been pushed to the spotlight, and purchasing house property has been regarded as one of the biggest challenging problems for the younger generations.

The key element of the project is the use of [Nation Bureau of Statistic of China](http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/), which had provide access to measures of the historical index of related index including (i)Yearly Housing Investment; (ii) Yearly Real Estate Development/Investment; (ii) Yealy Housing Price in major cities at detailed geographic levels (e.g. provinces, major cities) and time series for these measures dating back to 1996. Details of this dataset are described below in the data report.

We had breaked down our project into three sections as following:

- **Step 1**:
Firstly, a general perspective of the <b>nationwide</b> tendency of the real estate industry by using the stock price will be presented as a plot.

- **Step 2**:
Then, a basic statistics about the real estate investment distribution across <b> provinces </b> will presented in the map of China, with the contradiction before and after 2013 with the emergence of new tier-1.5 cities. The absolute value of investment and housing prices will be divided by the corresponding local population for standardization. 

- **Step 3**:
Finally, we plan to present three bar charts of tier-1, tier-1.5 and tier-2 cities that illustrates the relative changes before and after 2013 to visualize the influence of this emerging tier. The housing price per capita will be used as the measurement of the investment. This may be supplemented with another three corresponding bar charts of real estate on <b>city</b> level.

- **Step 4**:
Visualizing the three different level's data using the proper grapghic, and continue with a short analysis.

Our had investigate into the change in the real estate industry starting from a nationwide plot, then continued with the analysis across provinces and eventually narrow it down to the city level. With this in-depth examination into the real estate industry in China, we hope to see the renovation of investment structure and the direction of the current flow of the habit in investing real estate properties.
